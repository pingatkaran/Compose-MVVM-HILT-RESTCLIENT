# Android App Examples with Jetpack Compose

This project showcases various examples of an Android application built using Jetpack Compose. The primary functionalities include listing items, making network requests with Retrofit, using REST APIs, navigating through the app using Jetpack Compose Navigation, implementing dependency injection with Dagger Hilt, displaying sticky headers, and incorporating a bottom navigation bar.

## Features

1. **Listing**: Demonstrates how to create and display a list of items using Jetpack Compose.
2. **Jetpack Compose**: Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the UI components of the app.
3. **Retrofit**: Implements network requests using Retrofit to fetch data from REST APIs.
4. **REST API**: Connects to a REST API to retrieve and display data in the app.
5. **Navigation using Jetpack Compose**: Implements navigation between different screens using Jetpack Compose Navigation.
6. **Dagger Hilt**: Uses Dagger Hilt for dependency injection to manage dependencies efficiently.
7. **Sticky Headers**: Displays sticky headers in lists to group items under specific categories.
8. **Bottom Navigation**: Incorporates a bottom navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the app.
